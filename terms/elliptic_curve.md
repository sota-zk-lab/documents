## What Is An Elliptic Curve? []()

![Elliptic Curve Image](attachments/elliptic_curve.png)

The equation defining an elliptic curve is $y^{2} = x^{3} + ax + b$.

> [!WARNING]  
> An elliptic curve is not an ellipse.

You should also read about [elliptic curve group](elliptic_curve_group.md).

## Terminology

### Point of Infinity []()

$O$: a point that goes to infinity if we intersect two points in the curve symmetrically with respect to the y-axis.
You can imagine the third point as an infinite point lying at the infinite end of the y-axis.

> $P + O = P$

### Order Of A Curve []()

A curve has an "**order**"; there exists a number $n$ such that $P * n = O$ for any $P$.

> ==$=> P∗(n+1)=P$==
>
> $=> P∗(7∗n+5)=P∗5$

### Generator Point []()

There is also a commonly agreed-upon "generator point" $g$ (or $G$ interchangeably), which is understood to, in some
sense, represent the number "1".

> **Denote:** $\langle g \rangle = \mathbb{G}$

Theoretically, any point on a curve (except $O$) can be $g$; all that matters is that $g$ is standardized.

## Calculations On An Elliptic Curve

> $P + Q = R$

> $P + Q = O$ if and only if $x_{p} = x_{q}$, and $P + P = O$ if and only if $y_{p} = 0$.
