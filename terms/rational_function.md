# Rational Function

## Definition []()

**A rational function** is a mathematical function expressed as the quotient of two polynomials. It takes the form:

$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$

where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials, and $Q(x)$ is not the zero polynomial.

**The domain of a rational function** is the set of all $x$ values for which the denominator $Q(x)$ **is not equal to
zero** because division by zero is undefined. The range of the function is determined by the behavior of the numerator
and denominator polynomials.

Here are a few examples of rational functions:

1. $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 3}$
2. $g(x) = \frac{2x - 5}{x^2 + x + 1}$
3. $h(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
