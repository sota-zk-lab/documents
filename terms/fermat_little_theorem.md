# Fermat's Little Theorem []()

If $p$ is a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number"), then for any integer $a$:

> $a^{p} \equiv a \pmod {p}$

For instance, taking $a = 2$ and $p = 7$, we get $2^7 = 128$, and $128 − 2 = 126 = 7 × 18$ is an integer multiple of 7.

If $a$ is not divisible by $p$ (i.e., if $a$ is [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime "Coprime") to $p$),
then:

> $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod {p}$

As an example, when $a = 2$ and $p = 7$, we have $2^6 = 64$, and $64 − 1 = 63 = 7 × 9$, which is a multiple of 7.
