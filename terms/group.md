# Group

Informally, a group $G$ is any set equipped with an operation $(\cdot)$. A group must satisfy the following four
properties:

- Closure: the product of two elements in $G$ are also in $G$, i.e., for all $a,b ∈ G$, $a  \cdot  b$ is also in $G$.
- Associativity: for all $a,b, c ∈ G, a  \cdot (b  \cdot  c) = (a  \cdot  b) \cdot  c$.
- Identity: there an element denoted $1_G ∈ G$ such that $1_G  \cdot  g = g  \cdot  1_G = g$ for all $g ∈ G$
- Invertibility: For each $g ∈ G$, there is an element $h$ in $G$ such that $g \cdot h = 1_G$. This element $h$ is denoted $g^{−1}$ .
  An example is the the set of **invertible** matrices, which forms a group under the matrix multiplication operation.

A group $G$ is said to be **cyclic** if there is some group element $g$ such that all group elements can be generated by repeatedly
multiplying $g$ with itself, i.e., if every element of $G$ can be written as $g^i$ for some positive integer $i$. Such an element of
$g$ is called a generator for $G$. Any cyclic group is [abelian](abelian.md).

The cardinality $|G|$ is called the order of $G$. For any integer $ℓ$, if $z ≡ ℓ$ mod $|G|,$ then $g^ℓ = g^z$ (and $g^{|G|} = 1_G$).

A subgroup of a group $G$ is a subset $H$ of $G$ that itself forms a group under the same binary operation as $G$ itself.
