# Recursive SNARKs

Recursive SNARK means verifying a SNARK proof **inside** of another SNARK proof.
It allows prover to squeeze more knowledge into their proofs while
maintaining the succinctness properties of a SNARK.
For example, instead of producing proof of knowledge, one creates
proof that they know a proof.
