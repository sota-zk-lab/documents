# Characteristic []()

The characteristic of a finite field $F$ is the smallest positive number $n$ such that the sum of the multiplicative identity $1$
repeated $n$ times result in the additive identity $0$. This is expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 1 \cdot n = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

For example, if the field has characteristic $2$, it means that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 1 = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
