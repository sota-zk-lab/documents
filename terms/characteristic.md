# Characteristic

The characteristic of a finite field $F$ is the smallest positive number $n$ such that the sum of the multiplicative identity $1$
repeated $n$ times result in the additive identity $0$. This is expressed as:
$$1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 1 \cdot n = 0$$

For example, if the field has characteristic $2$, it means that:
$$1 + 1 = 0$$
