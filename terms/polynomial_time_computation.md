# Polynomial-time computation

## TLDR;
In the context of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), polynomial time refers to the efficiency with which a computational task can be completed. 
More specifically, a polynomial-time algorithm is one whose running time is polynomial in the size of the input. 
In contrast, exponential time algorithms grow much faster and are generally considered impractical for large inputs.

- **Examples:**
    - Polynomial-time examples include algorithms like bubble sort (\(O(n^2)\)) or matrix multiplication (\(O(n^3)\)).
    - Exponential-time examples include algorithms like brute-force search for certain combinatorial problems or many exact algorithms for NP-hard problems  \(O(2^n)\) or \(O(3^n)\).

In the realm of ZKPs, the concept of polynomial time is crucial because it relates to the efficiency of proving and verifying statements without revealing any additional information. Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a certain statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. The concept of polynomial time comes into play when evaluating the computational complexity of the algorithms used in the ZKP protocols.

Here's why polynomial time is important in the context of ZKPs:

1. **Efficiency:** Polynomial-time algorithms are generally considered efficient, making ZKPs practical for real-world applications. The goal is to have protocols that can be executed in a reasonable amount of time, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.

2. **Scalability:** Polynomial-time algorithms scale well with input size. This is important in scenarios where the size of the data or the complexity of the computation increases, and the ZKP protocol needs to remain feasible.

3. **Practical Applicability:** For ZKPs to be adopted in various domains, they need to be computationally feasible. Polynomial-time algorithms are more likely to be practical and applicable in real-world situations.

4. **Security:** The efficiency of the ZKP protocol also has implications for its security. If the protocol is too slow, it might be vulnerable to certain types of attacks or make it impractical for widespread use.

In summary, the efficiency of ZKPs, measured in terms of polynomial time, is crucial for their practicality and adoption in various applications where privacy and confidentiality are essential. It ensures that parties can engage in secure transactions or interactions without compromising the computational feasibility of the underlying cryptographic protocols.
