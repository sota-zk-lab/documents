# Holography

A system called holography (or a holographic system) is a system that employs a pre-processing, wherein a party can commit to
polynomials encoding the wiring of the circuit or R1CS instance. Subsequently, each time the circuit or R1CS is evaluated with a new
input, the verifier can operate in sublinear time relative to the circuit size.

This innovative technique enhances efficiency by facilitating quick verifications for new inputs without necessitating a
time-consuming process for each evaluation. The holographic system's ability to commit to circuit or R1CS structure through polynomial
encoding contributes to its streamlined and resource-efficient design.
