# Preimage Sampling

Preimage sampling is a process used in cryptographic systems, particularly in lattice-based cryptography. It involves finding a
preimage (an original input) that maps to a given output under a certain function, such that this preimage possesses specific
properties or lies within a desired distribution. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

## Context in Cryptography

1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography**:
    - In lattice-based cryptography, a common problem is finding short vectors in a lattice that satisfy certain conditions. The
      problem of finding a preimage that is short and satisfies a given constraint is crucial in constructing secure cryptographic
      schemes like digital signatures and public-key encryption.

2. **Hash Functions**:
    - In the context of hash functions, preimage sampling might involve finding an input that hashes to a particular output while
      satisfying some property, such as being within a certain range or having a specific structure.

## Importance and Applications

1. **Trapdoor Functions**:
    - Preimage sampling is often used with trapdoor functions. These functions are easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse
      unless you have special information (the trapdoor). Preimage sampling can leverage the trapdoor to efficiently find preimages
      with desired properties.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
    - In digital signature schemes like those based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) or Ring-LWE problems, preimage sampling is used
      to generate signatures that are both valid and short enough to ensure security and efficiency.

3. **Commitment Schemes**:
    - Preimage sampling is used in commitment schemes to ensure that a commitment can be opened to a specific value that meets required
      criteria.

## Example: Lattice-Based Cryptography

Consider the SIS (Short Integer Solution) problem:

- Given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$ and a vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, the task is to find a short
  vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} \mod q$.
- Preimage sampling involves finding such an $\mathbf{x}$ efficiently.

In lattice-based schemes, this can be done using algorithms like the Gaussian sampler, which samples vectors according to a discrete
Gaussian distribution centered around the target vector.
