# Knowledge Of Exponent (KOE)

Given points $P$ and $Q$ with $P . k = Q$ ($k$ is an unknown variable), and another point $C$, it is impossible to determine $C.k$
unless $C$ is "derived" from $P$ in a previously known or acknowledged relationship.

Consider a scenario where a pair of points $(P,Q)$ is provided, and $P.k=Q$, where the value of $k$ is unknown. Now, suppose we have
another pair $(R,S)$ with $R.k=S$. The knowledge of exponent assumption implies that the only way to generate the pair $(R,S)$ is by
taking $P$ and $Q$, and multiplying both by some factor $r$.
