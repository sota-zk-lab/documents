# Codeword []()

Given a vector $a = (a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \mathbb{F}_p^n$, $q(x)$ is the [low-degree extension](./low_degree_extension.md) of $a$.
Consider the vector $LDE(a)$ of length $p = |\mathbb{F}_p|$ whose $i$-th entry is $q(i)$. If $p\gg n$, then $LDE(a)$ is vastly
longer than $a$ itself and contains $a$ as a sub-vector. In the coding theory literature, $a$ is referred to as a message, and
the encoding $LDE(a)$ is called the **codeword** corresponding to message $a$.
