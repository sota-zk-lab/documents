# Discrete Logarithm

In real numbers, discrete logarithm $log_ab = k$ such that $a^k = b$

It get more interesting when we consider discrete logarithm in a finite field.

For example:

$a^k \equiv b$ (mod p)

In this case, we can only apply the equation from $a^k$ side and we can't do $log_ab$.

In elliptic curve, a point $G$ "dot" with itself k times would be written as $G * k$ so we would have the same property here. That way
we can't find $k$ from known $G$ and $D$ point which $G * k = D$.

The discrete logarithm problem is believed to be computationally intractable in certain [groups](group.md) $G$. An important caveat is
that quantum computers can solve the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time via Shorâ€™s algorithm. Hence, cryptosystems whose
security is based on the assumed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem are not post-quantum secure.
