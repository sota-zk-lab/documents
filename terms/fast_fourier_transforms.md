# Fast Fourier Transforms

## Background

Essentially, Fourier Transforms convert data between the
"frequency domain" and the "time domain". It means that if you have a piece of data, the algorithm will transform it into a
collection of sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes. Then, adding them together would approximate the
original data. See the depiction below.

![fourier_transforms](attachments/fourier_transforms.png)

The Fourier Transforms we discuss are discrete Fourier Transforms over the [finite field](./prime_or_finite_fields.md), rather than the
continuous Fourier Transforms over the *real or complex number* above. And, instead of focusing on the conversion between
"frequency domain" and "time domain", we primarily talk about two operations: **multi-point polynomial evaluation** and its
inverse, **polynomial interpolation**.

First, **multi-point polynomial evaluation** involves evaluating a degree $\lt N$ polynomial at $N$
different points. On the other hand, **polynomial interpolation** involves reconstructing the
polynomial based on its evaluations at $N$ different points.

For the first operation, you can separately evaluate the polynomial at each point by iterating over all the coefficients.
Thus, the total runtime is $O(N^2)$ (considering $N$ coefficients and $N$ points).
For the second operation, you first need to read about [Lagrange interpolation](./lagrange_interpolation.md) to understand how it
works and what Lagrange basis polynomials are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L_i(x) = \prod_{j=0, j \neq i}^{n} \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Compute this function takes $O(N^2)$ time (iterate $j$ take $O(N)$ times, and we need to compute $N$ functions).

Is this slow? Yes, and the Fast Fourier Transforms below will significantly speed up both operations.

## Fast Fourier Transforms []()

To utilize this algorithm, you must operate within a finite field, and the domain must be
a [multiplicative subgroup](./prime_or_finite_fields) of that field. Furthermore, the multiplicative subgroup must
have size $2^n$ in order to create a low-runtime recursive algorithm.

**High level idea:**
FFT works like [merge-sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/) . It takes a problem of size $N$, break it up into two problems
of size $\dfrac{N}{2}$, and do $O(N)$ work to combine two smaller solutions into the bigger one. So, the total run time is $O(NlogN)$.

### Multi-point Evaluation

Suppose that we have an FFT where the given domain is the powers of $w$ in some field, where $w^{2^k} = 1$ ($w$ is the domain
"generator").

For example, consider the finite field $F_{17}$, a polynomial: $f(x) = 1 + 13x + 3x^2 + 3x^3$ (we will write it as \[1, 13, 3, 3\]).
We want to evaluate this polynomial at each point in the domain, i.e., at the multiplicative subgroup of $4$:
$\lbrace 1, 4, 16, 13 \rbrace$.

First, we break up $f(x)$ into two parts, which we will call $evens$ and $odds$:

- $evens$: \[1, 3\] or $evens(x) = 1 + 3x$
- $odds$: \[13, 3\] or $odds(x) = 13 + 3x$

So, we have:

- $f(x) = evens(x^2) + x \cdot odds(x^2)$
- $f(-x) = evens(x^2) - x \cdot odds(x^2)$

Here, both $evens$ and $odds$ are polynomials half the size of $f(x)$ and the set of possible values of $x^2$ is only half the size of
the original domain: \[1, 4, 16, 13\] $\to$ \[1, 16\]. The reason is that:

- $1^2 = 1$
- $4^2 = 16$
- $16^2 = 256 \equiv 1\pmod {17}$
- $13^2 = 169 \equiv 16 \pmod {17}$

Hence, we can use FFT to compute $evens(x)$ or $odds(x)$ for every $x$ in the smaller domain consisting of squares of numbers in the
original domain. And, we've reduced a size - $N$ problem into half-size problem.

After receiving the evaluation of $evens$ and $odds$, we simply do:

- $f[i] = evens[i] + domain[i] \cdot odds[i]$
- $f[N/2 + i] = evens[i] - domain[i] \cdot odds[i]$

for each index $i$ from $0$ to $N/2 - 1$.

Python code for this:

```python
def fft(vals, modulus, domain):
    if len(vals) == 1:
        return vals
    L = fft(vals[::2], modulus, domain[::2])
    R = fft(vals[1::2], modulus, domain[::2])
    o = [0 for i in vals]
    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(L, R)):
        y_times_root = y * domain[i]
        o[i] = (x + y_times_root) % modulus
        o[i + len(L)] = (x - y_times_root) % modulus
    return o
```

We can try running it:

``` bash
>>> fft([1, 13, 3, 3], 17, [1, 4, 16, 13])
[3, 4, 5, 9]
```

### Polynomial Interpolation []()

To compute the inverse FFT, we run the FFT again , but reverse the result (except the first item stays in place) and divide every
value by the length of the list. The reason is that when we use `fft()`, we transform a vector
of $N$ coefficients into a vector of $N$ evaluations. This process can be viewed as converting
a matrix of size $N \times 1$ into another matrix of the same size. To accomplish this,
we perform matrix multiplication between the coefficient matrix and a square matrix of
size $N \times N$. That matrix, in the case of FFT, is called the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** matrix:

Then, for **polynomial interpolation**, we simply multiply the matrix of $N$ evaluations by the inverse
**DFT** matrix as follows:"

![inverse_DFT](attachments/inverse_dft.png)

So, the implementation of inverse FFT is simple:

```python
def inverse_fft(vals, modulus, domain):
    vals = fft(vals, modulus, domain)
    return [x * modular_inverse(len(vals), modulus) % modulus for x in [vals[0]] + vals[1:][::-1]]
```

We can use FFT to multiply numbers in time $O(NlogN)$ which $N$ is the length of numbers, faster than $O(N^2)$ schoolbook
multiplication.



## FFTs and Binary Fields

In a binary field, each element is expressed as a polynomial where all of the entries are 0 or 1, eg. $x^3+x+1$. Adding polynomials
is done modulo 2, and subtraction is the same as addition (as $âˆ’1=1 \mod2$). We select a irreducible polynomial as a modulus
(e.g., $x^4 + x + 1$) and multiplication is done modulo that modulus.

If you want to run FFT in a binary field, there is a problem:
In binary fields, there are *no multiplicative groups of order* $2^n$ because all the multiplicative groups are order $2^n - 1$.

For example, in the binary field with modulus $x^4+x+1$, if you start calculating successive powers of $x+1$, you cycle back to $1$
after $15$ steps - not $16$. The reason is that the elements list includes zero, but you're never going to reach zero by multiplying
any nonzero value by itself in a field, so the power of $x+1$ cycle through every element but zero.

So how can we halve the size of a domain? Here is the solution.

Given a domain containing $2^k$ values, including zero, we can construct a new half-size domain $D'$ by taking
$x \cdot (x+k)$. because the function $f(x) = x \cdot (x+k)$ returns the same value for $x$ and $x + k$.

| $x$               | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
|-------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| $x \cdot (x + 1)$ | 0 | 0 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 2  | 2  | 3  | 3  | 5  | 5  |

Let us explain this table:

- With $x = 0$: $x + 1 = 1$ $\to$ $x \cdot (x + 1) = 0 \cdot 1 = 0$
- With $x = 1$: $x + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 \to x \cdot (x+1) = 1 \cdot 0 = 0$
- ...
- With $x = 15 \iff x = 1111$; $x + 1 = 1111 + 0001 = 1110 = 14$ $\to x \cdot (x + 1) = 1111 \cdot 1110 = 0101 = 5$

So, to do FFT on binary field, we should convert $f(x)$ into:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) = evens(x \cdot (k-x)) + x \cdot odds(x \cdot (k-x))
\end{aligned}
$$

And $f(x + k) = evens((x + k) \cdot (-x)) + (x + k) \cdot odds((x+k) \cdot (-x))$
$= evens(x \cdot (k-x)) + (x + k) \cdot odds(x \cdot (k-x))$.

To convert $f(x)$ to $evens$ and $odds$ above in $O(N \cdot logN)$, we can use the
[freshman's dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman%27s_dream) theory that in binary field:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, do the same things as in the FFT section.

Here is the code for all the implementation that we mentioned above:
