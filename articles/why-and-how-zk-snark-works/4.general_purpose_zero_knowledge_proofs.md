## 4.1. Computation
This step is to translate the program into the polynomial form.
Example , we have a simple program : 
```javascript
function calc(w,a,b)
	if w then 
		return a x b
	else 
		return a + b
	else if 
end function
```

assuming $\omega \in \{0,1\}$  : 
$f(\omega,a,b) = \omega (a * b ) + (1- \omega )(a*b)$  
## 4.2. Single Operation 
Any computation at it is core consists of elemental operations of the form:
                 *left operand*  **operator** *right operand* = *output*
### 4.2.1. Arithmetic Properties of Polynomials
Let us consider two following polynomials : 
$f(x) = 2x^{2}-9x+10$
$g(x)=-4x^{2}+15x-9$ 
$h(x) = f(x) * g(x) = -8x^{4}+66x^{3}-193x^{2}+231x -90$

As we have :
$f(1) = 3, \space  g(1) =2, \space h(1) = 6 = 3 * 2$    
Moreover if we add $f(x) \space and \space g(x)$ , we have $s(x) = -2x^{2}+6x+1$  
$s(1)=5= 3+2$ 

## 4.3. Enforcing Operation
An operation polynomial can be represented :
$l(x) \space operator \space r(x) \space = \space o(x)$ 
* $l(x)$ : left operand
* $r(x)$ : right operand
* $o(x)$ : output of the operation
At a value $\alpha$ the operands and the output will be represented correctly if the evaluation of $l(\alpha) \space operator \space r(\alpha) \space = \space o(\alpha)$ should hold.
As the fact that the *operation polynomial* $l(\alpha) \space operator \space r(\alpha) \space -o(\alpha) = \space0$ has to evaluate to 0 at $\alpha$ $\Rightarrow \alpha$ is a root of *operation polynomial* so the *target polynomial* $t(x) = x- \alpha$ 
The operation polynomial then will be:
$$l(x)*r(x) = o(x)$$
In particular, $l(x) = 3x$ , $r(x) = 2x$ so $o(x)=6x$  :

$$
\begin{aligned}
 3x * 2x = 6x \\
 6x^{2}-6x = 0 \\
            \\
 6x(x-1)  = 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore if the prover provides such polynomials $l(x),r(x),o(x)$ instead of former $p(x)$. The verifier will accept it as valid since it's *divisible by $t(x)$*.
On the other side, if the prover tries to cheat and replace output with 4, $o(x)=4x$ , then the *operation polynomial* will be $6x^{2}-4x =0$, which not have a solution $x=1$  
Henceforth $l(x)*r(x) -o(x)$ is not divisible by $t(x)$ 

$\Rightarrow$ Not be accepted by the verifier.
