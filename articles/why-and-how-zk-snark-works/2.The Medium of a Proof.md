Let us consider **polynomials**, which can be visualized as a curve on a graph, shaped by a mathematical equation:

**Polynomials** have an advantageous property, namely, if we have two non-equal **polynomials** of degree at most d, they can intersect at no more than d points. For example, we have :

**The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra** tells us that a degree d **polynomial** can have at most d solutions , and therefore at most d shared points. In fact out of all choices of *x* to evaluate, only at most 3 choices will have equal evaluations in those polynomials and all others will differ. So we have a simple protocol here :
* Verifier chooses a random value for x and evaluates his polynomial locally 
* Verifier gives *x* to the prover and asks to evaluate the polynomial in question 
* Prover evaluates his polynomial at *x* and gives the result to the verifier 
* Verifier checks if the local result is equal to the prover’s result, and if so then the statement is proven with a high confidence
 For example, consider an integer range of *x* from 1 to 1077, the number of points where evaluations are different is *1077 − d*. Henceforth the probability that *x* accidentally “hits” any of the d shared points is equal to d 1077 , which is considered negligible.
