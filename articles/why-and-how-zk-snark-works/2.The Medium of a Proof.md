Let us consider **polynomials**, which can be visualized as a curve on a graph, shaped by mathematical equations:

**Polynomials** have an advantageous property, if we have two non-equal **polynomials** of degree at most d, they can intersect at no more than d points. For example :

**The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra** tells us that a degree d **polynomial** can have at most d solutions , and therefore at most d shared points.

In fact, out of all choices of *x* to evaluate, only at most 3 choices will have equal evaluations in those polynomials, and all others will differ. 
So we have a simple protocol here :
* The verifier chooses a random value for x and evaluates his polynomial locally 
* The verifier gives *x* to the prover and asks to evaluate the polynomial in question 
* The prover evaluates his polynomial at *x* and gives the result to the verifier 
* The verifier checks if the local result is equal to the prover’s result, and if so then the statement is proven with a high confidence

 Consider an integer range of *x* from 1 to $10^{77}$, the number of points where evaluations are different is *$10^{77}-d$*. Henceforth the probability that *x* accidentally “hits” any of the d shared points is equal to $\frac{d}{10^{77}}$ , which is considered negligible.
